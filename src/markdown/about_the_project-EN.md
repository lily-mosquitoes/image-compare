# Image Compare

This is a citizen science project which
aims to understand what is considered by
people as a "good" image when it comes to
images that have been artificially recovered
from some type of image degradation.

Currently we are testing images that have
been [denoised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction#In_images)
using a [modified first-order primal-dual algorithm](https://github.com/lily-mosquitoes/image-recovery).
