# How to Participare?

Here we will show you two images which have
been [denoised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction#In_images)
in a slightly different way, from a noisy image.

Your job is to tell us which one is best!
There's no right or wrong answer by the way,
our objective is to gather data on human
perception to potentially improve denoising
software used in many real world applications!
